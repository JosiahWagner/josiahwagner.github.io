### _Who am I?_

I am an Disciple, Husband, Father, and Engineer that is always trying to learn something new. This page is my attempt to
create a place to show off some of the cool things I've figured out how to do. I consider myself a "jack of all trades, 
master of none". I strive to learn and understand a little (sometimes a lot) of everything but I don't consider myself 
an expert in anything.

### _Things that interest me_

I like practically every science and engineering topic out there. If you know me, you'll know how often I can change what
I'm interested in but, whatever it is, it usually involves creating or designing something. This webpage exists out of my
specific desire to learn more about coding but I'm also interested in woodworking, cars, aircraft, semiconductors, 
photography, and a bunch of other things.
