# _Who am I?_

I am an Disciple, Husband, Father, and Engineer that is always trying to learn something new. This page is my attempt to 
create a place to show off some of my skills. I consider myself a "jack of all trades" and I strive to learn, understand, 
and develop expertise in as many areas as I can.

# _Things that interest me_

I'm interested in practically every science and engineering topic out there. If you know me, you'll know I have many 
different hobbies but, no matter what I'm focused on in the moment, it usually involves creating or designing something. 
This webpage exists out of my specific desire to learn more about coding but I'm also interested in woodworking, cars, 
aircraft, semiconductors, photography, among other things.
